# About

I'm a CS student. I like computer stuff. I love my vscode. I love my windows machine. I love python. I love old tech, old machines, old software. I prefer command line. I'm a fan of open source. I like to make things. I like to break things. I like to fix things. I like to learn new things. I like to teach things. I like to help people. I like to make people laugh. I like to make. I like to. I like. I.

This blog is a place for me to share my thoughts, ideas, and projects. I hope you find something useful here. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to [contact me](/contact/).
